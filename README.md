Exploring input and form fields in React/Redux, together with some tasty MUI design!

My Pizza Form is a simple assignment designed to explore form input and state management within React/Redux.
A Pizza Menu is a simple structure that allows experimentation with different form implementations (checkbox, radio dial, overall percentage increase, etc.).

This is also my first experience with Material-UI, something that I'll be implementing much earlier in development for future projects.

I'm happy with all the functionality, but would like to look at reducing the size of my Redux store - I think there is probably a cleaner solution that utilizes fewer individual reducers. I'd also like to utilize the custom styles available in MUI to make the design more impressive and individualistic.
